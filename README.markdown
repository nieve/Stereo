# MonoDevelop.Stereo

An attempt to add some resharper/refactoring functionalities to MonoDevelop Add-In, 
learning on the way how to work without VS.

Currently the add-in contains: 

* Generating classes and interfaces from not-yet-existing types references. Interfaces are generated following name conventions (i.e. ISomething). Invoke from context menue.
* Renaming namespaces - usings, namespace declerations and full type names references. Invoke from context menue.
* Move to another file - move any type not matching the name of the current file to a new file, baring the name of the moved type. Invoke by using Alt|Enter.
* Duplicate text - appends selected text or the current line. Invoke by using Ctrl|Alt|D.

## Installing

If you wish to start using the MonoDevelop.Stereo add-in without going through the pain of building, simply download the libraries only (found on the download page) and extract the MonoDevelop.Stereo folder found inside the zip directly to your %MonoDevelop Installation Path%\AddIns directory and you're ready to go.

## Building Pre-requisits

You will need to have the Mono Libraries Package installed on your machine in order to build the solution.
You can get it here: http://monodevelop.com/files/Windows/MonoLibraries.msi

## A work in progress

This is a work in progress, far from being a finalised product.
The decision I've taken in the beginning of my work on it was to deliver as much in as little time as possible, worrying more about functionality than any looks and aiming towards a seamless integration in the IDE, following its very own refactoring add-ins.
If you find any issues, problems or bugs please let me know, open an issue or even send a pull request if you feel like it. I'd appreciate any kind of feedback. Forkings, testing, bugs & issues, ideas and requests are welcome!

(More info to come...)
