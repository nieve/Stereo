# MonoDevelop.Stereo

An attempt to add some resharper/refactoring functionalities to MonoDevelop Add-In, 
learning on the way how to work without VS.

Currently the add-in contains: 

* Generating classes and interfaces from not-yet-existing types references. Interfaces are generated following name conventions (i.e. ISomething).
* Renaming namespaces - usings, namespace declerations and full type names references.

Forkings, testing, bugs & issues, ideas and requests are welcome!
