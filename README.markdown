# MonoDevelop.Stereo

An attempt to add some resharper/refactoring functionalities to MonoDevelop Add-In, 
learning on the way how to work without VS.

Currently the add-in contains: 

* Generating classes from not-yet-existing classes references
* Renaming namespaces (only usings and namespace declerations, not working for classes yet).

More info to come...
